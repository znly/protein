// BindProtofileSymbols finds the currently running executable then parses its
// symbol table in order to find every instanciated `proto.protoFiles` global
// variables.
//
// These `proto.protoFiles` variables are maintained by the various protobuf
// libraries out there (i.e. golang/protobuf, gogo/protobuf & other
// implementations) in order to keep track of the `FileDescriptorProto`s
// that have been loaded at boot-time (see `proto.RegisterFile`).
// This essentially means that each and every protobuf schema known
// to the currently running program is stored into one of these maps.
//
//
// There are two main issues that need to be worked around for this little
// trick to work though:
//
// A:
//   `proto.protoFiles` is a package-level private variable and, as such,
//   cannot (AFAIK) be accessed by any means except by forking the original
//   package, which is not a viable option here.
//
// B:
//   Because of how vendoring and mangling works, there can actually be an
//   infinite amount of `proto.protoFiles` variables instanciated at runtime,
//   and we must get ahold of each and every one of them.
//
// Considering the above issues, doing some hacking with the symbols seem
// to be the smart(er) way to go here.
// As `proto.protoFiles` variables are declared as package-level globals,
// their respective virtual addresses are known at compile-time and stored
// in the binary: what we're doing here is we find those addresses then
// apply some unsafe-foo magic in order to create local pointers that point
// to these addresses.
//
// And, voila!
